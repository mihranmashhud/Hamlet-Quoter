<h4><b>ACT I</b></h4>
<h4><b>SCENE II. A room of state in the castle.</b></h4>
<h4><b>LINES 1 - 39</b></h4>
<p><i>Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, HAMLET, POLONIUS, LAERTES, VOLTIMAND, CORNELIUS, Lords, and Attendants</i></p>
<p><b>KING CLAUDIUS</b></p>
<p>Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death</p>
<p>The memory be green, and that it us befitted</p>
<p>To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom</p>
<p>To be contracted in one brow of woe,</p>
<p>Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature</p>
<p>That we with wisest sorrow think on him,</p>
<p>Together with remembrance of ourselves.</p>
<p>Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,</p>
<p>The imperial jointress to this warlike state,</p>
<p>Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,--</p>
<p>With an auspicious and a dropping eye,</p>
<p>With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,</p>
<p>In equal scale weighing delight and dole,--</p>
<p>Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd</p>
<p>Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone</p>
<p>With this affair along. For all, our thanks.</p>
<p>Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,</p>
<p>Holding a weak supposal of our worth,</p>
<p>Or thinking by our late dear brother's death</p>
<p>Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,</p>
<p>Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,</p>
<p>He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,</p>
<p>Importing the surrender of those lands</p>
<p>Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,</p>
<p>To our most valiant brother. So much for him.</p>
<p>Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:</p>
<p>Thus much the business is: we have here writ</p>
<p>To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,--</p>
<p>Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears</p>
<p>Of this his nephew's purpose,--to suppress</p>
<p>His further gait herein; in that the levies,</p>
<p>The lists and full proportions, are all made</p>
<p>Out of his subject: and we here dispatch</p>
<p>You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,</p>
<p>For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;</p>
<p>Giving to you no further personal power</p>
<p>To business with the king, more than the scope</p>
<p>Of these delated articles allow.</p>
<p>Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.</p>
<h4><b>LINES 62 - 65</b></h4>
<p><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></p>
<p>I do beseech you, give him leave to go.</p>
<p><b>KING CLAUDIUS</b></p>
<p>Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,</p>
<p>And thy best graces spend it at thy will!</p>
<p>But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,--</p>
<h3><b>PAGE 2</b></h3>
<h4><b>LINES 87 - 117</b></h4>
<p><b>HAMLET</b></p>
<p>But I have that within which passeth show;</p>
<p>These but the trappings and the suits of woe.</p>
<p><b>KING CLAUDIUS</b></p>
<p>'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,</p>
<p>To give these mourning duties to your father:</p>
<p>But, you must know, your father lost a father;</p>
<p>That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound</p>
<p>In filial obligation for some term</p>
<p>To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever</p>
<p>In obstinate condolement is a course</p>
<p>Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;</p>
<p>It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,</p>
<p>A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,</p>
<p>An understanding simple and unschool'd:</p>
<p>For what we know must be and is as common</p>
<p>As any the most vulgar thing to sense,</p>
<p>Why should we in our peevish opposition</p>
<p>Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,</p>
<p>A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,</p>
<p>To reason most absurd: whose common theme</p>
<p>Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,</p>
<p>From the first corse till he that died to-day,</p>
<p>'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth</p>
<p>This unprevailing woe, and think of us</p>
<p>As of a father: for let the world take note,</p>
<p>You are the most immediate to our throne;</p>
<p>And with no less nobility of love</p>
<p>Than that which dearest father bears his son,</p>
<p>Do I impart toward you. For your intent</p>
<p>In going back to school in Wittenberg,</p>
<p>It is most retrograde to our desire:</p>
<p>And we beseech you, bend you to remain</p>
<h4><b>LINES 129 - 159</b></h4>
<p><b>KING CLAUDIUS</b></p>
<p>And the king's rouse the heavens all bruit again,</p>
<p>Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.</p>
<p><i>Exeunt all but HAMLET</i></p>
<p><b>HAMLET</b></p>
<p>O, that this too too solid flesh would melt</p>
<p>Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!</p>
<p>Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd</p>
<p>His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!</p>
<p>How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable,</p>
<p>Seem to me all the uses of this world!</p>
<p>Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,</p>
<p>That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature</p>
<p>Possess it merely. That it should come to this!</p>
<p>But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two:</p>
<p>So excellent a king; that was, to this,</p>
<p>Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother</p>
<p>That he might not beteem the winds of heaven</p>
<p>Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!</p>
<p>Must I remember? why, she would hang on him,</p>
<p>As if increase of appetite had grown</p>
<p>By what it fed on: and yet, within a month--</p>
<p>Let me not think on't--Frailty, thy name is woman!--</p>
<p>A little month, or ere those shoes were old</p>
<p>With which she follow'd my poor father's body,</p>
<p>Like Niobe, all tears:--why she, even she--</p>
<p>O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,</p>
<p>Would have mourn'd longer--married with my uncle,</p>
<p>My father's brother, but no more like my father</p>
<p>Than I to Hercules: within a month:</p>
<p>Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears</p>
<p>Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,</p>
<p>She married. O, most wicked speed, to post</p>
<p>With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!</p>
<h4><b>LINES 235 - 258</b></h4>
<p><b>HAMLET</b></p>
<p>Arm'd, say you?</p>
<p><b>BERNARDO</b></p>
<p>Arm'd, my lord.</p>
<p><b>HAMLET</b></p>
<p>From top to toe?</p>
<p><b>BERNARDO</b></p>
<p>My lord, from head to foot.</p>
<p><b>HAMLET</b></p>
<p>Then saw you not his face?</p>
<p><b>HORATIO</b></p>
<p>O, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up.</p>
<p><b>HAMLET</b></p>
<p>What, look'd he frowningly?</p>
<p><b>HORATIO</b></p>
<p>A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.</p>
<p><b>HAMLET</b></p>
<p>Pale or red?</p>
<p><b>HORATIO</b></p>
<p>Nay, very pale.</p>
<p><b>HAMLET</b></p>
<p>And fix'd his eyes upon you?</p>
<p><b>HORATIO</b></p>
<p>Most constantly.</p>
<p><b>HAMLET</b></p>
<p>I would I had been there.</p>
<p><b>HORATIO</b></p>
<p>It would have much amazed you.</p>
<p><b>HAMLET</b></p>
<p>Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?</p>
<p><b>HORATIO</b></p>
<p>While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.</p>
<p><b>BERNARDO</b></p>
<p>Longer, longer.</p>
<p><b>HORATIO</b></p>
<p>Not when I saw't.</p>
<p><b>HAMLET</b></p>
<p>His beard was grizzled--no?</p>
<p><b>HORATIO</b></p>
<p>It was, as I have seen it in his life,</p>
<p>A sable silver'd.</p>
<p><b>HAMLET</b></p>
<p>I will watch to-night;</p>
<p>Perchance 'twill walk again.</p>
<p><b>HORATIO</b></p>
<p>I warrant it will.</p>

<h4><b>SCENE III. A room in Polonius' house.</b></h4>
<h4><b>LINES 1 - 44</b></h4>
<p><i>Enter LAERTES and OPHELIA</i></p>
<p><b>LAERTES</b></p>
<p>My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:</p>
<p>And, sister, as the winds give benefit</p>
<p>And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,</p>
<p>But let me hear from you.</p>
<p><b>OPHELIA</b></p>
<p>Do you doubt that?</p>
<p><b>LAERTES</b></p>
<p>For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,</p>
<p>Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,</p>
<p>A violet in the youth of primy nature,</p>
<p>Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,</p>
<p>The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.</p>
<p><b>OPHELIA</b></p>
<p>No more but so?</p>
<p><b>LAERTES</b></p>
<p>Think it no more;</p>
<p>For nature, crescent, does not grow alone</p>
<p>In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,</p>
<p>The inward service of the mind and soul</p>
<p>Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,</p>
<p>And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch</p>
<p>The virtue of his will: but you must fear,</p>
<p>His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;</p>
<p>For he himself is subject to his birth:</p>
<p>He may not, as unvalued persons do,</p>
<p>Carve for himself; for on his choice depends</p>
<p>The safety and health of this whole state;</p>
<p>And therefore must his choice be circumscribed</p>
<p>Unto the voice and yielding of that body</p>
<p>Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,</p>
<p>It fits your wisdom so far to believe it</p>
<p>As he in his particular act and place</p>
<p>May give his saying deed; which is no further</p>
<p>Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.</p>
<p>Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,</p>
<p>If with too credent ear you list his songs,</p>
<p>Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open</p>
<p>To his unmaster'd importunity.</p>
<p>Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,</p>
<p>And keep you in the rear of your affection,</p>
<p>Out of the shot and danger of desire.</p>
<p>The chariest maid is prodigal enough,</p>
<p>If she unmask her beauty to the moon:</p>
<p>Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:</p>
<p>The canker galls the infants of the spring,</p>
<p>Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,</p>
<p>And in the morn and liquid dew of youth</p>
<p>Contagious blastments are most imminent.</p>
<h4><b>LINES 45 - 54</b></h4>
<p><b>LAERTES</b></p>
<p>Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:</p>
<p>Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.</p>
<p><b>OPHELIA</b></p>
<p>I shall the effect of this good lesson keep,</p>
<p>As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,</p>
<p>Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,</p>
<p>Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;</p>
<p>Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,</p>
<p>Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,</p>
<p>And recks not his own rede.</p>
<p><b>LAERTES</b></p>
<p>O, fear me not.</p>
<h4><b>LINES 55 - 81</b></h4>
<p><b>LAERTES</b></p>
<p>I stay too long: but here my father comes.</p>
<p><i>Enter POLONIUS</i></p>
<p>A double blessing is a double grace,</p>
<p>Occasion smiles upon a second leave.</p>
<p><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></p>
<p>Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!</p>
<p>The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,</p>
<p>And you are stay'd for. There; my blessing with thee!</p>
<p>And these few precepts in thy memory</p>
<p>See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,</p>
<p>Nor any unproportioned thought his act.</p>
<p>Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.</p>
<p>Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,</p>
<p>Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;</p>
<p>But do not dull thy palm with entertainment</p>
<p>Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware</p>
<p>Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,</p>
<p>Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.</p>
<p>Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;</p>
<p>Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.</p>
<p>Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,</p>
<p>But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;</p>
<p>For the apparel oft proclaims the man,</p>
<p>And they in France of the best rank and station</p>
<p>Are of a most select and generous chief in that.</p>
<p>Neither a borrower nor a lender be;</p>
<p>For loan oft loses both itself and friend,</p>
<p>And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.</p>
<p>This above all: to thine ownself be true,</p>
<h3><b>PAGE 4</b></h3>
<h4><b>LINES 82 - 88</b></h4>
<p><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></p>
<p>And it must follow, as the night the day,</p>
<p>Thou canst not then be false to any man.</p>
<p>Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!</p>
<p><b>LAERTES</b></p>
<p>Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.</p>
<p><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></p>
<p>The time invites you; go; your servants tend.</p>
<p><b>LAERTES</b></p>
<p>Farewell, Ophelia; and remember well</p>
<p>What I have said to you.</p>
<h4><b>LINES 89 - 111</b></h4>
<p><b>OPHELIA</b></p>
<p>'Tis in my memory lock'd,</p>
<p>And you yourself shall keep the key of it.</p>
<p><b>LAERTES</b></p>
<p>Farewell.</p>
<p><i>Exit</i></p>
<p><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></p>
<p>What is't, Ophelia, be hath said to you?</p>
<p><b>OPHELIA</b></p>
<p>So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.</p>
<p><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></p>
<p>Marry, well bethought:</p>
<p>'Tis told me, he hath very oft of late</p>
<p>Given private time to you; and you yourself</p>
<p>Have of your audience been most free and bounteous:</p>
<p>If it be so, as so 'tis put on me,</p>
<p>And that in way of caution, I must tell you,</p>
<p>You do not understand yourself so clearly</p>
<p>As it behoves my daughter and your honour.</p>
<p>What is between you? give me up the truth.</p>
<p><b>OPHELIA</b></p>
<p>He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders</p>
<p>Of his affection to me.</p>
<p><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></p>
<p>Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,</p>
<p>Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.</p>
<p>Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?</p>
<p><b>OPHELIA</b></p>
<p>I do not know, my lord, what I should think.</p>
<p><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></p>
<p>Marry, I'll teach you: think yourself a baby;</p>
<p>That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,</p>
<p>Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;</p>
<h4><b>LINES 112 - 136</b></h4>
<p><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></p>
<p>Or--not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,</p>
<p>Running it thus--you'll tender me a fool.</p>
<p><b>OPHELIA</b></p>
<p>My lord, he hath importuned me with love</p>
<p>In honourable fashion.</p>
<p><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></p>
<p>Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.</p>
<p><b>OPHELIA</b></p>
<p>And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,</p>
<p>With almost all the holy vows of heaven.</p>
<p><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></p>
<p>Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,</p>
<p>When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul</p>
<p>Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,</p>
<p>Giving more light than heat, extinct in both,</p>
<p>Even in their promise, as it is a-making,</p>
<p>You must not take for fire. From this time</p>
<p>Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence;</p>
<p>Set your entreatments at a higher rate</p>
<p>Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,</p>
<p>Believe so much in him, that he is young</p>
<p>And with a larger tether may he walk</p>
<p>Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,</p>
<p>Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,</p>
<p>Not of that dye which their investments show,</p>
<p>But mere implorators of unholy suits,</p>
<p>Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,</p>
<p>The better to beguile. This is for all:</p>
<p>I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth,</p>
<h4><b>SCENE IV. The platform.</b></h4>
<h4><b>LINES 1 - 57</b></h4>
<p><i>Enter HAMLET, HORATIO, and MARCELLUS</i></p>
<p><b>HAMLET</b></p>
<p>The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.</p>
<p><b>HORATIO</b></p>
<p>It is a nipping and an eager air.</p>
<p><b>HAMLET</b></p>
<p>What hour now?</p>
<p><b>HORATIO</b></p>
<p>I think it lacks of twelve.</p>
<p><b>HAMLET</b></p>
<p>No, it is struck.</p>
<p><b>HORATIO</b></p>
<p>Indeed? I heard it not: then it draws near the season</p>
<p>Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.</p>
<p><i>A flourish of trumpets, and ordnance shot off, within</i></p>
<p>What does this mean, my lord?</p>
<p><b>HAMLET</b></p>
<p>The king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,</p>
<p>Keeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring reels;</p>
<p>And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,</p>
<p>The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out</p>
<p>The triumph of his pledge.</p>
<p><b>HORATIO</b></p>
<p>Is it a custom?</p>
<p><b>HAMLET</b></p>
<p>Ay, marry, is't:</p>
<p>But to my mind, though I am native here</p>
<p>And to the manner born, it is a custom</p>
<p>More honour'd in the breach than the observance.</p>
<p>This heavy-headed revel east and west</p>
<p>Makes us traduced and tax'd of other nations:</p>
<p>They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase</p>
<p>Soil our addition; and indeed it takes</p>
<p>From our achievements, though perform'd at height,</p>
<p>The pith and marrow of our attribute.</p>
<p>So, oft it chances in particular men,</p>
<p>That for some vicious mole of nature in them,</p>
<p>As, in their birth--wherein they are not guilty,</p>
<p>Since nature cannot choose his origin--</p>
<p>By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,</p>
<p>Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,</p>
<p>Or by some habit that too much o'er-leavens</p>
<p>The form of plausive manners, that these men,</p>
<p>Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,</p>
<p>Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,--</p>
<p>Their virtues else--be they as pure as grace,</p>
<p>As infinite as man may undergo--</p>
<p>Shall in the general censure take corruption</p>
<p>From that particular fault: the dram of eale</p>
<p>Doth all the noble substance of a doubt</p>
<p>To his own scandal.</p>
<p><b>HORATIO</b></p>
<p>Look, my lord, it comes!</p>
<p><i>Enter Ghost</i></p>
<p><b>HAMLET</b></p>
<p>Angels and ministers of grace defend us!</p>
<p>Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,</p>
<p>Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,</p>
<p>Be thy intents wicked or charitable,</p>
<p>Thou comest in such a questionable shape</p>
<p>That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet,</p>
<p>King, father, royal Dane: O, answer me!</p>
<p>Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell</p>
<p>Why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death,</p>
<p>Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,</p>
<p>Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,</p>
<p>Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws,</p>
<p>To cast thee up again. What may this mean,</p>
<p>That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel</p>
<p>Revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon,</p>
<p>Making night hideous; and we fools of nature</p>
<h3><b>PAGE 5</b></h3>
<h4><b>LINES 58 - 78</b></h4>
<p><b>HAMLET</b></p>
<p>So horridly to shake our disposition</p>
<p>With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?</p>
<p>Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we do?</p>
<p><i>Ghost beckons HAMLET</i></p>
<p><b>HORATIO</b></p>
<p>It beckons you to go away with it,</p>
<p>As if it some impartment did desire</p>
<p>To you alone.</p>
<p><b>MARCELLUS</b></p>
<p>Look, with what courteous action</p>
<p>It waves you to a more removed ground:</p>
<p>But do not go with it.</p>
<p><b>HORATIO</b></p>
<p>No, by no means.</p>
<p><b>HAMLET</b></p>
<p>It will not speak; then I will follow it.</p>
<p><b>HORATIO</b></p>
<p>Do not, my lord.</p>
<p><b>HAMLET</b></p>
<p>Why, what should be the fear?</p>
<p>I do not set my life in a pin's fee;</p>
<p>And for my soul, what can it do to that,</p>
<p>Being a thing immortal as itself?</p>
<p>It waves me forth again: I'll follow it.</p>
<p><b>HORATIO</b></p>
<p>What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,</p>
<p>Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff</p>
<p>That beetles o'er his base into the sea,</p>
<p>And there assume some other horrible form,</p>
<h4><b>LINES 79 - 92</b></h4>
<p><b>HORATIO</b></p>
<p>Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason</p>
<p>And draw you into madness? think of it:</p>
<p>The very place puts toys of desperation,</p>
<p>Without more motive, into every brain</p>
<p>That looks so many fathoms to the sea</p>
<p>And hears it roar beneath.</p>
<p><b>HAMLET</b></p>
<p>It waves me still.</p>
<p>Go on; I'll follow thee.</p>
<p><b>MARCELLUS</b></p>
<p>You shall not go, my lord.</p>
<p><b>HAMLET</b></p>
<p>Hold off your hands.</p>
<p><b>HORATIO</b></p>
<p>Be ruled; you shall not go.</p>
<p><b>HAMLET</b></p>
<p>My fate cries out,</p>
<p>And makes each petty artery in this body</p>
<p>As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.</p>

<p><i>Enter GHOST and HAMLET</i></p>

<p>I will.</p>
<p><b>Ghost</b></p>
<p>My hour is almost come,</p>
<p>When I to sulphurous and tormenting flames</p>
<p>Must render up myself.</p>

<p>Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature</p>
<p>Are burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid</p>
<p>To tell the secrets of my prison-house,</p>

<p><b>HAMLET</b></p>
<p>O my prophetic soul! My uncle!</p>
<p><b>Ghost</b></p>
<p>Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,</p>
<p>With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,--</p>
<p>O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power</p>
<p>So to seduce!--won to his shameful lust</p>
<p>The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:</p>
<p>O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!</p>
<p>From me, whose love was of that dignity</p>
<p>That it went hand in hand even with the vow</p>
<p>I made to her in marriage, and to decline</p>
<p>Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor</p>
<p>To those of mine!</p>
<p>But virtue, as it never will be moved,</p>
<p>Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,</p>
<p>So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,</p>
<p>Will sate itself in a celestial bed,</p>
<p>And prey on garbage.</p>
<p>But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air;</p>
<p>Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,</p>
<p>My custom always of the afternoon,</p>
<p>Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,</p>
<p>With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,</p>
<p>And in the porches of my ears did pour</p>
<p>The leperous distilment; whose effect</p>
<p>Holds such an enmity with blood of man</p>
<p>That swift as quicksilver it courses through</p>
<p>The natural gates and alleys of the body,</p>
<p>And with a sudden vigour doth posset</p>
<p>And curd, like eager droppings into milk,</p>
<p>The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine;</p>
<p>And a most instant tetter bark'd about,</p>
<p>Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust,</p>

<p>Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand</p>
<p>Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd:</p>
<p>Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,</p>
<p>Unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd,</p>
<p>No reckoning made, but sent to my account</p>
<p>With all my imperfections on my head:</p>
<p>O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!</p>
<p>If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;</p>
<p>Let not the royal bed of Denmark be</p>
<p>A couch for luxury and damned incest.</p>
<p>But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,</p>

<p>Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat</p>
<p>In this distracted globe. Remember thee!</p>
<p>Yea, from the table of my memory</p>
<p>I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,</p>

<h4><b>LINES 1 - 37</b></h4>
<p><i>Enter POLONIUS and REYNALDO</i></p>
<p><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></p>
<p>Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.</p>
<p><b>REYNALDO</b></p>
<p>I will, my lord.</p>
<p><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></p>
<p>You shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo,</p>
<p>Before you visit him, to make inquire</p>
<p>Of his behavior.</p>
<p><b>REYNALDO</b></p>
<p>My lord, I did intend it.</p>
<p><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></p>
<p>Marry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir,</p>
<p>Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;</p>
<p>And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,</p>
<p>What company, at what expense; and finding</p>
<p>By this encompassment and drift of question</p>
<p>That they do know my son, come you more nearer</p>
<p>Than your particular demands will touch it:</p>
<p>Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;</p>
<p>As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,</p>
<p>And in part him: ' do you mark this, Reynaldo?</p>
<p><b>REYNALDO</b></p>
<p>Ay, very well, my lord.</p>
<p><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></p>
<p>'And in part him; but' you may say 'not well:</p>
<p>But, if't be he I mean, he's very wild;</p>
<p>Addicted so and so:' and there put on him</p>
<p>What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank</p>
<p>As may dishonour him; take heed of that;</p>
<p>But, sir, such wanton, wild and usual slips</p>
<p>As are companions noted and most known</p>
<p>To youth and liberty.</p>
<p><b>REYNALDO</b></p>
<p>As gaming, my lord.</p>
<p><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></p>
<p>Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,</p>
<p>Drabbing: you may go so far.</p>
<p><b>REYNALDO</b></p>
<p>My lord, that would dishonour him.</p>
<p><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></p>
<p>'Faith, no; as you may season it in the charge</p>
<p>You must not put another scandal on him,</p>
<p>That he is open to incontinency;</p>
<p>That's not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly</p>
<p>That they may seem the taints of liberty,</p>
<p>The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,</p>
<p>A savageness in unreclaimed blood,</p>
<p>Of general assault.</p>
<h4><b>LINES 38 - 69</b></h4>
<p><b>REYNALDO</b></p>
<p>But, my good lord,--</p>
<p><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></p>
<p>Wherefore should you do this?</p>
<p><b>REYNALDO</b></p>
<p>Ay, my lord,</p>
<p>I would know that.</p>
<p><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></p>
<p>Marry, sir, here's my drift;</p>
<p>And I believe, it is a fetch of wit:</p>
<p>You laying these slight sullies on my son,</p>
<p>As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' the working, Mark you,</p>
<p>Your party in converse, him you would sound,</p>
<p>Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes</p>
<p>The youth you breathe of guilty, be assured</p>
<p>He closes with you in this consequence;</p>
<p>'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman,'</p>
<p>According to the phrase or the addition</p>
<p>Of man and country.</p>
<p><b>REYNALDO</b></p>
<p>Very good, my lord.</p>
<p><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></p>
<p>And then, sir, does he this--he does--what was I</p>
<p>about to say? By the mass, I was about to say</p>
<p>something: where did I leave?</p>
<p><b>REYNALDO</b></p>
<p>At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,'</p>
<p>and 'gentleman.'</p>
<p><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></p>
<p>At 'closes in the consequence,' ay, marry;</p>
<p>He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman;</p>
<p>I saw him yesterday, or t' other day,</p>
<p>Or then, or then; with such, or such; and, as you say,</p>
<p>There was a' gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;</p>
<p>There falling out at tennis:' or perchance,</p>
<p>'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'</p>
<p>Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.</p>
<p>See you now;</p>
<p>Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth:</p>
<p>And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,</p>
<h4><b>LINES 70 - 86</b></h4>
<p><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></p>
<p>With windlasses and with assays of bias,</p>
<p>By indirections find directions out:</p>
<p>So by my former lecture and advice,</p>
<p>Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?</p>
<p><b>REYNALDO</b></p>
<p>My lord, I have.</p>
<p><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></p>
<p>God be wi' you; fare you well.</p>
<p><b>REYNALDO</b></p>
<p>Good my lord!</p>
<p><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></p>
<p>Observe his inclination in yourself.</p>
<p><b>REYNALDO</b></p>
<p>I shall, my lord.</p>
<p><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></p>
<p>And let him ply his music.</p>
<p><b>REYNALDO</b></p>
<p>Well, my lord.</p>
<p><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></p>

<p><b>OPHELIA</b></p>
<p>O, my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!</p>
<p><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></p>
<p>With what, i' the name of God?</p>
<p><b>OPHELIA</b></p>
<p>My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,</p>
<p>Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced;</p>
<h4><b>LINES 87 - 120</b></h4>
<p><b>OPHELIA</b></p>
<p>No hat upon his head; his stockings foul'd,</p>
<p>Ungarter'd, and down-gyved to his ancle;</p>
<p>Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other;</p>
<p>And with a look so piteous in purport</p>
<p>As if he had been loosed out of hell</p>
<p>To speak of horrors,--he comes before me.</p>
<p><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></p>
<p>Mad for thy love?</p>
<p><b>OPHELIA</b></p>
<p>My lord, I do not know;</p>
<p>But truly, I do fear it.</p>
<p><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></p>
<p>What said he?</p>
<p><b>OPHELIA</b></p>
<p>He took me by the wrist and held me hard;</p>
<p>Then goes he to the length of all his arm;</p>
<p>And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,</p>
<p>He falls to such perusal of my face</p>
<p>As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so;</p>
<p>At last, a little shaking of mine arm</p>
<p>And thrice his head thus waving up and down,</p>
<p>He raised a sigh so piteous and profound</p>
<p>As it did seem to shatter all his bulk</p>
<p>And end his being: that done, he lets me go:</p>
<p>And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd,</p>
<p>He seem'd to find his way without his eyes;</p>
<p>For out o' doors he went without their helps,</p>
<p>And, to the last, bended their light on me.</p>
<p><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></p>
<p>Come, go with me: I will go seek the king.</p>
<p>This is the very ecstasy of love,</p>
<p>Whose violent property fordoes itself</p>
<p>And leads the will to desperate undertakings</p>
<p>As oft as any passion under heaven</p>
<p>That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.</p>
<p>What, have you given him any hard words of late?</p>
<p><b>OPHELIA</b></p>
<p>No, my good lord, but, as you did command,</p>
<p>I did repel his fetters and denied</p>
<p>His access to me.</p>

<p>Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!</p>
<p>Moreover that we much did long to see you,</p>
<p>The need we have to use you did provoke</p>
<p>Our hasty sending. Something have you heard</p>
<p>Of Hamlet's transformation; so call it,</p>

<p>More than his father's death, that thus hath put him</p>

<p>I cannot dream of: I entreat you both,</p>
<p>That, being of so young days brought up with him,</p>

<p><b>VOLTIMAND</b></p>
<p>Most fair return of greetings and desires.</p>

<p>But, better look'd into, he truly found</p>
<p>It was against your highness: whereat grieved,</p>
<p>That so his sickness, age and impotence</p>

<p>On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys;</p>
<p>Receives rebuke from Norway, and in fine</p>
<p>Makes vow before his uncle never more</p>
<p>To give the assay of arms against your majesty.</p>
<p>Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,</p>

<h4><b>LINES 97 - 112</b></h4>
<p><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></p>
<p>And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,</p>
<p>I will be brief: your noble son is mad:</p>

<p><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></p>

<p>That she should lock herself from his resort,</p>

<p>Well, God-a-mercy.</p>
<p><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></p>

<p><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></p>
<p>Honest, my lord!</p>
<p><b>HAMLET</b></p>
<p>Ay, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to be</p>
<p>one man picked out of ten thousand.</p>
<p><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></p>
<p>That's very true, my lord.</p>
<p><b>HAMLET</b></p>
<p>For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a</p>

<p><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></p>

<p>I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.</p>
<p><b>HAMLET</b></p>
<p>Slanders, sir: for the satirical rogue says here</p>
<p>that old men have grey beards, that their faces are</p>
<p>wrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber and</p>
<p>plum-tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of</p>

<p>you could go backward.</p>
<p><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></p>

<p>None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.</p>
<p><b>HAMLET</b></p>
<p>Then is doomsday near: but your news is not true.</p>
<p>Let me question more in particular: what have you,</p>

<p>that she sends you to prison hither?</p>
<p><b>GUILDENSTERN</b></p>
<p>Prison, my lord!</p>

<p><b>ROSENCRANTZ</b></p>
<p>We think not so, my lord.</p>
<p><b>HAMLET</b></p>
<p>Why, then, 'tis none to you; for there is nothing</p>
<p>either good or bad, but thinking makes it so: to me</p>
<p>it is a prison.</p>
<p><b>ROSENCRANTZ</b></p>
<p>Why then, your ambition makes it one; 'tis too</p>
<p>narrow for your mind.</p>
<p><b>HAMLET</b></p>
<p>O God, I could be bounded in a nut shell and count</p>
<p>myself a king of infinite space, were it not that I</p>
<p>have bad dreams.</p>
<p><b>GUILDENSTERN</b></p>
<p>Which dreams indeed are ambition, for the very</p>
<p>substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.</p>

<p>A dream itself is but a shadow.</p>
<h4><b>LINES 274 - 277</b></h4>
<p><b>ROSENCRANTZ</b></p>
<p>Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a</p>

<p>We'll wait upon you.</p>
<p><b>HAMLET</b></p>
<p>No such matter: I will not sort you with the rest</p>

<p>too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for? Is it</p>

<p>I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation</p>
<p>prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the king</p>
<p>and queen moult no feather. I have of late--but</p>
<p>wherefore I know not--lost all my mirth, forgone all</p>
<p>custom of exercises; and indeed it goes so heavily</p>
<p>with my disposition that this goodly frame, the</p>
<p>earth, seems to me a sterile promontory, this most</p>
<p>excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave</p>
<h4><b>LINES 314 - 337</b></h4>
<p><b>HAMLET</b></p>
<p>o'erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted</p>
<p>with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to</p>
<p>me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours.</p>
<p>What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason!</p>
<p>how infinite in faculty! in form and moving how</p>
<p>express and admirable! in action how like an angel!</p>
<p>in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the</p>
<p>world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me,</p>
<p>what is this quintessence of dust? man delights not</p>
<p>me: no, nor woman neither, though by your smiling</p>
<p>you seem to say so.</p>
<p><b>ROSENCRANTZ</b></p>
<p>My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.</p>
<p><b>HAMLET</b></p>
<p>Why did you laugh then, when I said 'man delights not me'?</p>
<p><b>ROSENCRANTZ</b></p>
<p>To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what</p>
<p>lenten entertainment the players shall receive from</p>
<p>you: we coted them on the way; and hither are they</p>
<p>coming, to offer you service.</p>
<p><b>HAMLET</b></p>
<p>He that plays the king shall be welcome; his majesty</p>
<p>shall have tribute of me; the adventurous knight</p>
<p>shall use his foil and target; the lover shall not</p>
<p>sigh gratis; the humourous man shall end his part</p>
<p>in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose</p>
<p>lungs are tickled o' the sere; and the lady shall</p>
<p>say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt</p>
<h4><b>LINES 338 - 356</b></h4>
<p><b>HAMLET</b></p>
<p>for't. What players are they?</p>
<p><b>ROSENCRANTZ</b></p>
<p>Even those you were wont to take delight in, the</p>
<p>tragedians of the city.</p>
<p><b>HAMLET</b></p>
<p>How chances it they travel? their residence, both</p>
<p>in reputation and profit, was better both ways.</p>
<p><b>ROSENCRANTZ</b></p>
<p>I think their inhibition comes by the means of the</p>
<p>late innovation.</p>
<p><b>HAMLET</b></p>
<p>Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was</p>
<p>in the city? are they so followed?</p>
<p><b>ROSENCRANTZ</b></p>
<p>No, indeed, are they not.</p>
<p><b>HAMLET</b></p>
<p>How comes it? do they grow rusty?</p>
<p><b>ROSENCRANTZ</b></p>
<p>Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace: but</p>
<p>there is, sir, an aery of children, little eyases,</p>
<p>that cry out on the top of question, and are most</p>
<p>tyrannically clapped for't: these are now the</p>
<p>fashion, and so berattle the common stages--so they</p>
<p>call them--that many wearing rapiers are afraid of</p>
<p>goose-quills and dare scarce come thither.</p>
<p><b>HAMLET</b></p>
<p>What, are they children? who maintains 'em? how are</p>

<p><b>HAMLET</b></p>
<p>afterwards, if they should grow themselves to common</p>
<p>players--as it is most like, if their means are no</p>
<p>better--their writers do them wrong, to make them</p>
<p>exclaim against their own succession?</p>
<p><b>ROSENCRANTZ</b></p>
<p>'Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and</p>
<p>the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to</p>
<p>controversy: there was, for a while, no money bid</p>
<p>for argument, unless the poet and the player went to</p>
<p>cuffs in the question.</p>
<p><b>HAMLET</b></p>

<p><b>ROSENCRANTZ</b></p>
<p>Ay, that they do, my lord; Hercules and his load too.</p>

<p>It is not very strange; for mine uncle is king of</p>

<p>at this line: let me see, let me see--</p>
<p>'The rugged Pyrrhus, like the Hyrcanian beast,'--</p>
<p>it is not so:--it begins with Pyrrhus:--</p>
<p>'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,</p>
<p>Black as his purpose, did the night resemble</p>
<p>When he lay couched in the ominous horse,</p>
<p>Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd</p>
<p>With heraldry more dismal; head to foot</p>
<p>Now is he total gules; horridly trick'd</p>
<p>With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,</p>
<p>Baked and impasted with the parching streets,</p>
<p>That lend a tyrannous and damned light</p>
<p>To their lord's murder: roasted in wrath and fire,</p>
<h4><b>LINES 471 - 486</b></h4>
<p><b>HAMLET</b></p>
<p>And thus o'er-sized with coagulate gore,</p>
<p>With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus</p>
<p>Old grandsire Priam seeks.'</p>
<p>So, proceed you.</p>
<p><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></p>
<p>'Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and</p>
<p>good discretion.</p>
<p><b>First Player</b></p>
<p>'Anon he finds him</p>
<p>Striking too short at Greeks; his antique sword,</p>
<p>Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,</p>
<p>Repugnant to command: unequal match'd,</p>
<p>Pyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide;</p>
<p>But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword</p>
<p>The unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,</p>
<p>Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top</p>
<p>Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash</p>
<p>Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear: for, lo! his sword,</p>
<h4><b>LINES 487 - 492</b></h4>
<p><b>First Player</b></p>
<p>Which was declining on the milky head</p>
<p>Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' the air to stick:</p>
<p>So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,</p>
<p>And like a neutral to his will and matter,</p>
<p>Did nothing.</p>
<p>But, as we often see, against some storm,</p>
<h4><b>LINES 493 - 508</b></h4>
<p><b>First Player</b></p>
<p>A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,</p>
<p>The bold winds speechless and the orb below</p>
<p>As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder</p>
<p>Doth rend the region, so, after Pyrrhus' pause,</p>
<p>Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work;</p>
<p>And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall</p>
<p>On Mars's armour forged for proof eterne</p>
<p>With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword</p>
<p>Now falls on Priam.</p>
<p>Out, out, thou strumpet, Fortune! All you gods,</p>
<p>In general synod 'take away her power;</p>
<p>Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,</p>
<p>And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,</p>
<p>As low as to the fiends!'</p>
<p><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></p>
<p>This is too long.</p>
<p><b>HAMLET</b></p>
<p>It shall to the barber's, with your beard. Prithee,</p>
<h4><b>LINES 509 - 527</b></h4>
<p><b>HAMLET</b></p>
<p>say on: he's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he</p>
<p>sleeps: say on: come to Hecuba.</p>
<p><b>First Player</b></p>
<p>'But who, O, who had seen the mobled queen--'</p>
<p><b>HAMLET</b></p>
<p>'The mobled queen?'</p>
<p><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></p>
<p>That's good; 'mobled queen' is good.</p>
<p><b>First Player</b></p>
<p>'Run barefoot up and down, threatening the flames</p>
<p>With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head</p>
<p>Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,</p>
<p>About her lank and all o'er-teemed loins,</p>
<p>A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up;</p>
<p>Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd,</p>
<p>'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have</p>
<p>pronounced:</p>
<p>But if the gods themselves did see her then</p>
<p>When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport</p>
<p>In mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,</p>
<p>The instant burst of clamour that she made,</p>
<p>Unless things mortal move them not at all,</p>
<p>Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven,</p>
