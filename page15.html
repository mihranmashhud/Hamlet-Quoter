<blockquote class="line">It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">A brother's murder. Pray can I not,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Though inclination be as sharp as will:</blockquote>

<blockquote class="line">And, like a man to double business bound,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">I stand in pause where I shall first begin,</blockquote>

<blockquote class="line">Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">But to confront the visage of offence?</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">And what's in prayer but this two-fold force,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">To be forestalled ere we come to fall,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murder'?</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">That cannot be; since I am still possess'd</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Of those effects for which I did the murder,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">My crown, mine own ambition and my queen.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">May one be pardon'd and retain the offence?</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">In the corrupted currents of this world</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Buys out the law: but 'tis not so above;</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">There is no shuffling, there the action lies</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">In his true nature; and we ourselves compell'd,</blockquote>
