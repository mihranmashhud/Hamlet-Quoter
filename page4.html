<p class="speaker"><b>OPHELIA</b></p>

<p class="speaker"><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></p>
<blockquote class="line">Marry, well bethought:</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">'Tis told me, he hath very oft of late</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Given private time to you; and you yourself</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Have of your audience been most free and bounteous:</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">If it be so, as so 'tis put on me,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">And that in way of caution, I must tell you,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">You do not understand yourself so clearly</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">As it behoves my daughter and your honour.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">What is between you? give me up the truth.</blockquote>
<p class="speaker"><b>OPHELIA</b></p>
<blockquote class="line">He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Of his affection to me.</blockquote>
<p class="speaker"><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></p>
<blockquote class="line">Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?</blockquote>

<p class="speaker"><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></p>

<h4 class="lines" id="lines112-136"><b>LINES 112 - 136</b></h4>
<p class="speaker"><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></p>
<blockquote class="line">Or--not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,</blockquote>

<p class="speaker"><b>OPHELIA</b></p>

<p class="speaker"><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></p>

<p class="speaker"><b>OPHELIA</b></p>

<p class="speaker"><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></p>
<blockquote class="line">Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,</blockquote>

<blockquote class="line">You must not take for fire. From this time</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence;</blockquote>

<blockquote class="line">Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Believe so much in him, that he is young</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">And with a larger tether may he walk</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Not of that dye which their investments show,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">But mere implorators of unholy suits,</blockquote>

<p class="speaker"><b>HAMLET</b></p>
<blockquote class="line">The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.</blockquote>
<p class="speaker"><b>HORATIO</b></p>
<blockquote class="line">It is a nipping and an eager air.</blockquote>
<p class="speaker"><b>HAMLET</b></p>
<blockquote class="line">What hour now?</blockquote>
<p class="speaker"><b>HORATIO</b></p>
<blockquote class="line">I think it lacks of twelve.</blockquote>
<p class="speaker"><b>HAMLET</b></p>
<blockquote class="line">No, it is struck.</blockquote>
<p class="speaker"><b>HORATIO</b></p>
<blockquote class="line">Indeed? I heard it not: then it draws near the season</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.</blockquote>
<p class="action"><i>A flourish of trumpets, and ordnance shot off, within</i></p>
<blockquote class="line">What does this mean, my lord?</blockquote>
<p class="speaker"><b>HAMLET</b></p>
<blockquote class="line">The king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Keeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring reels;</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">The triumph of his pledge.</blockquote>
<p class="speaker"><b>HORATIO</b></p>
<blockquote class="line">Is it a custom?</blockquote>
<p class="speaker"><b>HAMLET</b></p>
<blockquote class="line">Ay, marry, is't:</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">But to my mind, though I am native here</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">And to the manner born, it is a custom</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">More honour'd in the breach than the observance.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">This heavy-headed revel east and west</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Makes us traduced and tax'd of other nations:</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Soil our addition; and indeed it takes</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">From our achievements, though perform'd at height,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">The pith and marrow of our attribute.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">So, oft it chances in particular men,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">That for some vicious mole of nature in them,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">As, in their birth--wherein they are not guilty,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Since nature cannot choose his origin--</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Or by some habit that too much o'er-leavens</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">The form of plausive manners, that these men,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,--</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Their virtues else--be they as pure as grace,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">As infinite as man may undergo--</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Shall in the general censure take corruption</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">From that particular fault: the dram of eale</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Doth all the noble substance of a doubt</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">To his own scandal.</blockquote>
<p class="speaker"><b>HORATIO</b></p>
<blockquote class="line">Look, my lord, it comes!</blockquote>
<p class="action"><i>Enter Ghost</i></p>
<p class="speaker"><b>HAMLET</b></p>
<blockquote class="line">Angels and ministers of grace defend us!</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Be thy intents wicked or charitable,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Thou comest in such a questionable shape</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">King, father, royal Dane: O, answer me!</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">To cast thee up again. What may this mean,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Making night hideous; and we fools of nature</blockquote>
