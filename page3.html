<h4 class="lines" id="lines1-44"><b>LINES 1 - 44</b></h4>
<p class="action"><i>Enter LAERTES and OPHELIA</i></p>
<p class="speaker"><b>LAERTES</b></p>
<blockquote class="line">My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">And, sister, as the winds give benefit</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">But let me hear from you.</blockquote>
<p class="speaker"><b>OPHELIA</b></p>
<blockquote class="line">Do you doubt that?</blockquote>
<p class="speaker"><b>LAERTES</b></p>
<blockquote class="line">For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">A violet in the youth of primy nature,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.</blockquote>
<p class="speaker"><b>OPHELIA</b></p>
<blockquote class="line">No more but so?</blockquote>
<p class="speaker"><b>LAERTES</b></p>
<blockquote class="line">Think it no more;</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">For nature, crescent, does not grow alone</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">The inward service of the mind and soul</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">The virtue of his will: but you must fear,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">For he himself is subject to his birth:</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">He may not, as unvalued persons do,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Carve for himself; for on his choice depends</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">The safety and health of this whole state;</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">And therefore must his choice be circumscribed</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Unto the voice and yielding of that body</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">It fits your wisdom so far to believe it</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">As he in his particular act and place</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">May give his saying deed; which is no further</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">If with too credent ear you list his songs,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">To his unmaster'd importunity.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">And keep you in the rear of your affection,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Out of the shot and danger of desire.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">The chariest maid is prodigal enough,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">If she unmask her beauty to the moon:</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">The canker galls the infants of the spring,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">And in the morn and liquid dew of youth</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Contagious blastments are most imminent.</blockquote>
<h4 class="lines" id="lines45-54"><b>LINES 45 - 54</b></h4>
<p class="speaker"><b>LAERTES</b></p>
<blockquote class="line">Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.</blockquote>
<p class="speaker"><b>OPHELIA</b></p>
<blockquote class="line">I shall the effect of this good lesson keep,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">And recks not his own rede.</blockquote>
<p class="speaker"><b>LAERTES</b></p>
<blockquote class="line">O, fear me not.</blockquote>
<h4 class="lines" id="lines55-81"><b>LINES 55 - 81</b></h4>
<p class="speaker"><b>LAERTES</b></p>
<blockquote class="line">I stay too long: but here my father comes.</blockquote>
<p class="action"><i>Enter POLONIUS</i></p>
<blockquote class="line">A double blessing is a double grace,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Occasion smiles upon a second leave.</blockquote>
<p class="speaker"><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></p>
<blockquote class="line">Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">And you are stay'd for. There; my blessing with thee!</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">And these few precepts in thy memory</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Nor any unproportioned thought his act.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">But do not dull thy palm with entertainment</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">For the apparel oft proclaims the man,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">And they in France of the best rank and station</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Are of a most select and generous chief in that.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Neither a borrower nor a lender be;</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">For loan oft loses both itself and friend,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">This above all: to thine ownself be true,</blockquote>
