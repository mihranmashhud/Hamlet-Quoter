<p class="speaker"><b>REYNALDO</b></p>
<blockquote class="line">I will, my lord.</blockquote>
<p class="speaker"><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></p>
<blockquote class="line">You shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Before you visit him, to make inquire</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Of his behavior.</blockquote>
<p class="speaker"><b>REYNALDO</b></p>
<blockquote class="line">My lord, I did intend it.</blockquote>
<p class="speaker"><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></p>
<blockquote class="line">Marry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">What company, at what expense; and finding</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">By this encompassment and drift of question</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">That they do know my son, come you more nearer</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Than your particular demands will touch it:</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">And in part him: ' do you mark this, Reynaldo?</blockquote>
<p class="speaker"><b>REYNALDO</b></p>
<blockquote class="line">Ay, very well, my lord.</blockquote>
<p class="speaker"><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></p>
<blockquote class="line">'And in part him; but' you may say 'not well:</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">But, if't be he I mean, he's very wild;</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Addicted so and so:' and there put on him</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">As may dishonour him; take heed of that;</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">But, sir, such wanton, wild and usual slips</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">As are companions noted and most known</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">To youth and liberty.</blockquote>
<p class="speaker"><b>REYNALDO</b></p>
<blockquote class="line">As gaming, my lord.</blockquote>
<p class="speaker"><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></p>
<blockquote class="line">Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Drabbing: you may go so far.</blockquote>
<p class="speaker"><b>REYNALDO</b></p>
<blockquote class="line">My lord, that would dishonour him.</blockquote>
<p class="speaker"><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></p>
<blockquote class="line">'Faith, no; as you may season it in the charge</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">You must not put another scandal on him,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">That he is open to incontinency;</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">That's not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">That they may seem the taints of liberty,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">A savageness in unreclaimed blood,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Of general assault.</blockquote>

<p class="speaker"><b>REYNALDO</b></p>
<blockquote class="line">Ay, my lord,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">I would know that.</blockquote>
<p class="speaker"><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></p>
<blockquote class="line">Marry, sir, here's my drift;</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">And I believe, it is a fetch of wit:</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">You laying these slight sullies on my son,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' the working, Mark you,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Your party in converse, him you would sound,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">The youth you breathe of guilty, be assured</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">He closes with you in this consequence;</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman,'</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">According to the phrase or the addition</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Of man and country.</blockquote>
<p class="speaker"><b>REYNALDO</b></p>
<blockquote class="line">Very good, my lord.</blockquote>
<p class="speaker"><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></p>
<blockquote class="line">And then, sir, does he this--he does--what was I</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">about to say? By the mass, I was about to say</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">something: where did I leave?</blockquote>
<p class="speaker"><b>REYNALDO</b></p>
<blockquote class="line">At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,'</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">and 'gentleman.'</blockquote>
<p class="speaker"><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></p>
<blockquote class="line">At 'closes in the consequence,' ay, marry;</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman;</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">I saw him yesterday, or t' other day,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Or then, or then; with such, or such; and, as you say,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">There was a' gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">There falling out at tennis:' or perchance,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">See you now;</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth:</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,</blockquote>

<p class="speaker"><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></p>
<blockquote class="line">With windlasses and with assays of bias,</blockquote>

<blockquote class="line">So by my former lecture and advice,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?</blockquote>
<p class="speaker"><b>REYNALDO</b></p>
<blockquote class="line">My lord, I have.</blockquote>
<p class="speaker"><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></p>
<blockquote class="line">God be wi' you; fare you well.</blockquote>
<p class="speaker"><b>REYNALDO</b></p>
<blockquote class="line">Good my lord!</blockquote>
<p class="speaker"><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></p>

<p class="speaker"><b>REYNALDO</b></p>
<blockquote class="line">I shall, my lord.</blockquote>
<p class="speaker"><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></p>
<blockquote class="line">And let him ply his music.</blockquote>
<p class="speaker"><b>REYNALDO</b></p>

<p class="speaker"><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></p>
<blockquote class="line">Farewell!</blockquote>
<p class="action"><i>Exit REYNALDO</i></p>

<blockquote class="line">How now, Ophelia! what's the matter?</blockquote>
<p class="speaker"><b>OPHELIA</b></p>
<blockquote class="line">O, my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!</blockquote>
<p class="speaker"><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></p>
<blockquote class="line">With what, i' the name of God?</blockquote>
<p class="speaker"><b>OPHELIA</b></p>
<blockquote class="line">My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced;</blockquote>
<h4 class="lines" id="lines87-120"><b>LINES 87 - 120</b></h4>
<p class="speaker"><b>OPHELIA</b></p>
<blockquote class="line">No hat upon his head; his stockings foul'd,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Ungarter'd, and down-gyved to his ancle;</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other;</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">And with a look so piteous in purport</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">As if he had been loosed out of hell</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">To speak of horrors,--he comes before me.</blockquote>
<p class="speaker"><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></p>
<blockquote class="line">Mad for thy love?</blockquote>
<p class="speaker"><b>OPHELIA</b></p>
<blockquote class="line">My lord, I do not know;</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">But truly, I do fear it.</blockquote>
<p class="speaker"><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></p>
<blockquote class="line">What said he?</blockquote>
<p class="speaker"><b>OPHELIA</b></p>
<blockquote class="line">He took me by the wrist and held me hard;</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Then goes he to the length of all his arm;</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">He falls to such perusal of my face</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so;</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">At last, a little shaking of mine arm</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">And thrice his head thus waving up and down,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">He raised a sigh so piteous and profound</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">As it did seem to shatter all his bulk</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">And end his being: that done, he lets me go:</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">He seem'd to find his way without his eyes;</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">For out o' doors he went without their helps,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">And, to the last, bended their light on me.</blockquote>
<p class="speaker"><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></p>
<blockquote class="line">Come, go with me: I will go seek the king.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">This is the very ecstasy of love,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">Whose violent property fordoes itself</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">And leads the will to desperate undertakings</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">As oft as any passion under heaven</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">What, have you given him any hard words of late?</blockquote>
<p class="speaker"><b>OPHELIA</b></p>
<blockquote class="line">No, my good lord, but, as you did command,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">I did repel his fetters and denied</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line">His access to me.</blockquote>
